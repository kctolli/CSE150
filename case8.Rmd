## Background

Data scientists need to have resumes that show strong experience in solving real-world problems. While employers know that their job candidates need experience, they often donâ€™t know what experience they need and often list too many requirements.

### Challenge

To finish the semester you will need to create your hypothetical resume that you could use upon graduation from BYU-I to a data science or analytics position. Your resume will need to combine the three elements of coursework available, the real-work experience you can accumulate over your next few years before graduation, and the job requirements of the currently available positions for undergraduate data scientists.

## Deliverables

* A one-page dream data science [resume](https://kctolli.github.io/site_libs/resume.html).
* A second page of sources that you used to justify the stuff in your resume.
* A [cover letter](./analysis/cs8.html) that describes what you have learned from this course.
