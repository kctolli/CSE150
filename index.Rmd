## Summary

This course will introduce you to data science and provide insight into how to use data to make decisions using visualization and statistical inference. Data scientists spend a significant amount of their time cleaning and manipulating data for use in decision making. In this course, we have crafted real-world data for use in our learning to offset much of the work around data cleaning and manipulation. CSE 250, CSE 350/Math 335, CIT 111, CIT 225 and other advanced analytics courses like CSE 450 and Math 488 can help you build those skills.

### Why This Class

You are driven by curiosity and interested in how data decisions are made (sometimes called data intuition). Possibly, you have a more empathetic approach to how the world works and how problems can be solved. Finally, you have an eye for visualization and how data is communicated to make impactful decisions. 

### Principles of teaching Data Science

* Organize the course around a set of diverse case studies
* Integrate computing into every aspect of the course
* Teach abstraction, but minimize reliance on mathematical notation
* Structure course activities to realistically mimic a data scientistâ€™s experience
* Demonstrate the importance of critical thinking/skepticism through examples

## Course Outcomes

1. Organize and store tabular data for time-series, spatial, and measured variables.
2. Calculate data summaries and produce visualizations from data.
3. Communicate about data with people of varied backgrounds (e.g., novices, database administrators, data scientists, business decision-makers).
4. Describe the implications of data visualization and summaries in the decision-making process.
